                            This project is my bachelor thesis, and you can find the full text and source files on my GitHub. 
                            The aim was to create a post-quantum blockchain. I analyzed how quantum computers threaten current blockchains, 
                            identified suitable post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, implemented the blockchain, and studied the 
                            impact of these algorithms on performance.<br><br>
                            I learned a lot about blockchains and cryptography through this project. I'm happy with the results, 
                            and the work earned an A grade. Here is a shorter version of the thesis with introduction, analysis, and results.

                            The development of quantum computers presents new opportunities but also introduces a threat by compromising 
                            currently used cryptographic algorithms. This threat significantly impacts blockchain technology, which relies 
                            on various cryptographic principles. The objective is to design and implement a blockchain that incorporates 
                            new post-quantum cryptographic algorithms resistant to attacks performed by quantum computers. The main part 
                            of the solution involves analyzing blockchain components vulnerable to quantum attacks, selecting appropriate 
                            post-quantum algorithms, and subsequently implementing them within the blockchain. The result of this work is 
                            an overview of blockchain vulnerabilities and their solutions in the post-quantum era. Additionally, the 
                            implemented solution compares the performance of multiple post-quantum and currently used algorithms. 
                            The results show that post-quantum cryptography can have a significant impact on blockchain performance. However, 
                            post-quantum blockchains will still be usable, and they will withstand the era of quantum computers.

                    <p>
                        The risks are mainly associated with threats to the currently used cryptography. 
                        A specific concern arises from the capability of quantum computers to solve
                        certain mathematical problems much more efficiently than classical computers.
                        Many existing encryption algorithms rely on these mathematical problems’ complexity, 
                        which makes them vulnerable to quantum threats [3].

                    <p>
                        There are already algorithms designed specifically for quantum computers
                        that pose a direct threat. Notably, Shor’s algorithms [10] address the efficient
                        factorization of large numbers and the Discrete Logarithm problem. These problems 
                        exhibit exponential complexity on classical computers but only linear complexity 
                        on quantum computers. This poses a direct risk to current asymmetric
                        cryptography. Specifically for algorithms RSA and DSA, as well as elliptic curves
                        algorithms Ed25519 or ECDSA.

                    <p>
                        Additionally, Grover’s algorithm [6], a quantum search algorithm, can search
                        an unsorted database with <span class="math inline">\(O(n^{1/2})\)</span> complexity [2]. This algorithm can be used
                        to efficiently search for collisions in currently used hash functions, which pose a
                        threat to applications that require non-collision hash functions.

                    <p>
                        From this point of view, the current situation is somewhat unusual. We know
                        how to break current cryptographic algorithms such as RSA –we need to efficiently 
                        factor large numbers. We know an algorithm that can do this – Shor’s
                        algorithm. The only thing we still lack is a sufficiently powerful quantum computer.

                    <p>
                        The response to the quantum threat lies in quantum-resistant cryptography, often 
                        referred to as post-quantum (PQ) cryptography. This form of cryptography
                        is designed to provide robust encryption against the capabilities of both quantum 
                        and classical computers. Notably, the National Institute of Standards and
                        Technology (NIST) has taken a significant initiative in this domain, launching a
                        competition to standardize one or more quantum-resistant algorithms. From this
                        competition, four algorithms have already been selected for standardization. The
                        CRYSTALS-Kyber algorithm was chosen for the Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) 
                        category, and three algorithms –CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon,
                        and SPHINCS+ – were selected for the digital signature category. For these algorithms, 
                        NIST has defined 5 security levels [9]:

                        Compared to currently used cryptography, PQ cryptography has lower performance 
                        and there are also large differences in the sizes of keys, ciphertext,
                        and signatures. Typically, in current cryptography, the size of keys and digital
                        signatures is in the order of hundreds to thousands of bits, in the case of elliptic
                        curves cryptography it is even less than a hundred bits. Keys, ciphertext, and
                        signatures in PQ cryptography are significantly larger (see Table 1).

                        Particularly for blockchain technology, the size of keys and digital signatures
                        can pose significant challenges. Since they are often stored within a blockchain,
                        this can cause substantial growth in its overall size.

                        typically calculated using the Merkle tree procedure. As mentioned Grover’s algorithm

                        To mitigate this threat, it is crucial to employ a hash function with
                        an adequate output length.

                        In the case of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and other consensus mechanisms that use
                        the concept of randomness, it is important to choose a reliable random generator.
                        Theoretically, PQ computers will be able to find the deterministic nature of
                        the pseudo-random generated values, as long as this process is based on the
                        phenomenon of classical physics [8]. In PoS, this vulnerability could empower
                        a malicious actor to manipulate stake height to increase the likelihood of being
                        more frequently chosen as the final validator. This issue is not restricted to
                        consensus mechanisms; many cryptographic algorithms rely on pseudo-random
                        number generators. However, the solution lies in quantum random generators,
                        which are also a hot topic in the PQ era. The key is to integrate them into
                        existing solutions and use them instead of current pseudo-random generators as
                        soon as they are available.

                        use the principle of PoW or random selection of validators, but validators
                        cooperate to achieve the consensus. However, this consensus uses a special
                        type of messages called proposals that require digital signatures, so even
                        there has to be employed mentioned PQ cryptography.

                        The testing aimed to evaluate the performance of the implemented blockchain
                        with the utilization of various algorithms for digital signatures. Testing was
                        performed by initializing several Docker1 containers, with each container running
                        one node instance.

                        of the application, and the amount of data sent/received during the runtime.
                        Processor cycles were measured using the Linux utility perf stat2, memory
                        utilization data was obtained from Docker stats, and the amount of transferred

                        The purpose of this scenario is to measure how size and performance requirements 
                        grow with the increasing number of nodes and transactions. Tests were
                        performed with 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 nodes, each creating 20 transactions over
                        50 seconds with an additional 30 seconds to reach a consensus. After this time,
                        all nodes were stopped and performance statistics were captured. Subsequently,
                        the results from all nodes across all five rounds were averaged. So, for example,
                        with 10 nodes, there were averaged performance results from 10 nodes, and this
                        process was repeated five times, and finally, all results were averaged.

                        The chart in Figure 2 shows the average number of processor cycles performed
                        by the application using different algorithms for digital signatures. Falcon’s PQ
                        algorithms are almost at the same level as the currently used Ed25519 algorithm.
                        Dilithium’s PQ algorithms are somewhat worse, but their results are not bad
                        for practical use. In the categories of PQ algorithms, Falcon dominates mainly
                        because it has a very fast signature verification process. Although the Dilithium
                        algorithms have a much faster signing process, in blockchains the signing is only
                        used when creating transactions and proposals and is performed only by their
                        creator, while each node performs the signature verification of all transactions.

                        during tests with different digital signature algorithms. The growth in memory
                        allocation is not too steep across configurations with different node numbers.
                        This is primarily because the utilized consensus mechanism creates a new block
                        every few seconds, and after that, the new block is saved, and allocated data are
                        freed. As a result, transactions do not accumulate and take up less memory.

                        Amounts of transferred data The chart in Figure 3 shows average amounts
                        of sent/received data during tests with different digital signature algorithms.
                        Currently used algorithms Ed25519 and ECDSA are almost at the same level.
                        The results of PQ algorithms correspond to their security levels; higher security
                        levels entail larger keys and signatures, which results in a higher volume of
                        transferred data. This graph highlights one of the major disadvantages of PQ
                        cryptography for blockchains. The data transfer requirements grow significantly
                        as the number of executed transactions or nodes in the network increases. While
                        the growth is relatively moderate with the currently used algorithms it becomes
                        more influential with PQ algorithms. For example, in the case of Dilithium5,
                        when doubling the number of nodes from 10 to 20, the amount of transferred data
                        is more than tripled. This growth is logical, and the results of this observation did
                        not even need to be tested practically, as they can be approximately calculated.

                        factor is the effectiveness of a signature verification process. In this metric
                        dominate Falcon algorithms, which are in terms of performance very close
                        to the currently widely used algorithm Ed25519. Dilithium algorithms are

                        Because of the sizes of PQ keys and signatures, applications utilizing PQ
                        cryptography may necessitate the allocation of additional heap memory.
                        This could potentially impact performance, as extensive heap memory usage
                        might result in increased swapping to disk swap space. For blockchains, the
                        results show that a consensus mechanism that creates new blocks more often
                        with fewer transactions in one block can ensure that the program uses less
                        allocated memory.

                        The primary concern for blockchains arises from the sizes of PQ keys and
                        signatures. The results indicate that with PQ digital signature algorithms,
                        individual nodes are required to transfer larger volumes of data compared
                        to the presently employed ECDSA and Ed25519 algorithms. This not only
                        escalates network traffic but also accelerates the overall growth of the blockchain’s 
                        size. The key factor here is the number of active nodes in the block-
                        chain network and the volume of transactions they generate. Furthermore,
                        this issue may get even more significant if a hybrid combination of classical
                        and PQ cryptography is employed for enhanced security.

                        The important part of this thesis was also the analysis of blockchain and its
                        vulnerabilities against quantum threats. Most of the threads are related to cryptography. 
                        For this reason, this thesis analyzed new PQ algorithms and examined
                        their suitability for use in blockchains. These analyses were then used to design
                        and implement a blockchain resistant to quantum attacks. The implementation
                        employs multiple PQ and currently used algorithms, which were compared in
                        terms of performance to highlight the differences between PQ and current 
                        cryptography in blockchains.

                        The performance tests showed that PQ cryptography in blockchains is usable.
                        Beneficial are mainly algorithms with fast digital signature verification. However,
                        the main problem is the size of the public keys and digital signatures. The nodes
                        in the blockchain network have to transfer larger amounts of data, and the overall
                        size of the blockchains also grows significantly faster.
