                                Compiler implementation for imperative language IFJ22 (based on PHP).<br>
                                This is a team project, created in the C programming language. 4 people worked on this project. My work on the project was lexical analysis, symbol table, abstract data structures stack and hash table.<br>
                                The result is a program that receives the code written in IFJ22 at the input and returns compiled intermediate code similar to assembler.<br>
                                During the project, I had the opportunity to enhance my teamwork skills while putting my practical knowledge of the versioning system Git into action. Furthermore, I was able to apply my solid foundation in C programming, which proved beneficial to the success of the project.

                                A tool for scanning TCP/UDP ports, inspired by the nmap tool.<br>
                                The program is developed in C/C++ language, utilizing the pcap-library.<br>
                                The result is a program capable of scanning TCP/UDP ports on both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The program supports scanning using hostnames and allows specifying specific ports or port ranges.<br>
                                Through this project, I gained knowledge about the functioning of TCP, UDP protocols, as well as IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. Additionally, I acquired experience in object-oriented programming in C++.

                                A program for finding a hidden message within an image using pixels on prime number indexes.<br>
                                The program is written in C language and utilizes a bit array, combined with a simple implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes, to find prime numbers.<br>
                                The result is a program capable of finding the hidden message within an image. Additionally, the program can output the last 10 prime numbers smaller than 300,000.<br>
                                Throughout the project, I primarily improved my programming skills in C and learned to work more effectively with pointers and memory indexing. I also experimented with potential compiler optimizations and compared the speed of macros against inline functions in C.

                                Implementation of a data structure called a hash table in the C language.<br>
                                The program is implemented in C and includes functions for working with the hash table, including dynamic resizing based on its current occupancy.<br>
                                The result is an abstract data structure - a hash table, along with a program that can count the occurrences of individual words in a given text document.<br>
                                This project helped me improve my programming skills in the C language. Additionally, I gained experience in creating static and dynamic libraries in C.

                                A client that can connect to a remote calculator.<br>
                                The implementation is done in C/C++ language and uses TCP/UDP protocols based on the chosen variant.<br>
                                The program is capable of receiving and sending messages using TCP/UDP protocol to a specified IP address or hostname through a selected port.<br>
                                Throughout this project, I gained knowledge about the functioning principles of TCP and UDP protocols. I also had the opportunity to practice handling program interruption in C/C++.

                                A program that interprets code written in the language of symbolic instructions IPPcode23, which is processed from an XML file.<br>
                                This program is implemented in Python.<br>
                                Through this project, I improved my knowledge of the Python language and also had the opportunity to practice object-oriented programming.

                                An SQL script that creates a database for a construction company.<br>
                                The database design was created using an ER diagram that meets the company's requirements.<br>
                                The script includes commands for creating tables, implementing database triggers, procedures, materialized views, and also an explain plan to monitor the optimization of SQL queries.<br>  
                                Through this project, I learned how to work with SQL, use SQL queries, triggers, procedures, and other useful SQL constructs.
