                            <div class="paragraph">
                                <p>
                                    I am a university student from Slovakia, currently studying at the Brno University of Technology, 
                                    Faculty of Information Technology. Having recently completed my bachelor's degree, I am now 
                                    pursuing a master's degree with a focus on artificial intelligence and security.<br><br>
                                    My bachelor's thesis was about creating a blockchain resistant to quantum attacks, which combined 
                                    blockchains and cryptography. It was graded A and taught me a lot about blockchain technology and 
                                    post-quantum cryptography. For my master's thesis, I plan to focus on Web 3.0, a subject I am eager 
                                    to explore further. I have also completed the Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) course from ISC2 and my 
                                    technical skills include proficiency in C/C++, Python, and SQL, along with experience in blockchain development.<br><br>
                                    My interests encompass decentralized networks, blockchains, Web 3.0, computer networks, security, 
                                    and software engineering. After graduation, I aim to start my career in a dynamic tech company where 
                                    I can further develop my skills and contribute to impactful projects.<br><br>
                                    In my free time, I work on various projects to expand my knowledge and experience with new technologies. 
                                    These projects include learning to program in <em>Rust</em>, using the <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> library, and creating a home network 
                                    security monitoring system. You can find all my projects on my GitHub account.<br><br>
                                    Feel free to connect with me to discuss technology, coding, or potential collaboration opportunities.

                                            <b>Problem-Solving</b> I think this is an elemental skill for every engineer. 
                                            There are always problems that require solutions. For me, the most important 
                                            are <em>critical thinking</em>, <em>creativity</em>, and <em>decision making</em>.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <b>Time Management</b> I am trying to be as organized as possible to manage my time effectively. 
                                            I always have a TODO list with priorities and plan for the next day. On busy days or difficult projects, 
                                            I also make myself a more detailed schedule. No plan or schedule is perfect, so <em>I believe that a good plan is 
                                            only one that can be changed at any time.</em>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <b>Communication</b> I consider myself a quiet person. But it depends on the people around me. 
                                            With people smarter than me, I used to listen; with people at my knowledge level, I used to actively discuss; 
                                            and if I am with less smart people than I am, I would rather leave the room. The important aspects for me are 
                                            being <em>clear</em>, <em>effective</em>, and sometimes use humor, so the conversation is less boring.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <b>Teamwork</b> In modern software development, it is practically impossible to develop something alone. 
                                            It is a team game and I am always trying to be a strong team player.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <b>Leadership</b> I am not a natural leader, but whenever somebody gives me leadership I am ready to take 
                                            responsibility for <em>decisions</em>, <em>delegation</em>, and <em>management</em>. I see my strength also in providing 
                                            <em>guidance</em> and <em>support</em> to other colleagues.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <b>Work Ethic</b> I keep my word so that I can be <em>trustworthy</em> to others. Important aspects for me are being 
                                            <em>reliable</em>, <em>honest</em>, <em>positive</em>, and <em>motivating</em> others. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <b>Adaptability</b> Technologies are rapidly changing. For me are important <em>principles</em>, and I am always open to learning 
                                            new stuff and discovering new ideas.

                                            Compiler implementation for imperative language IFJ22 (based on PHP). This is a team project, 
                                            created in the C programming language. 4 people worked on this project. My work on the project 
                                            was lexical analysis, symbol table, abstract data structures stack and hash table. The result 
                                            is a program that receives the code written in IFJ22 at the input and returns compiled intermediate 
                                            code similar to assembler. During the project, I had the opportunity to enhance my teamwork skills 
                                            while putting my practical knowledge of the versioning system Git into action. Furthermore, 
                                            I was able to apply my solid foundation in C programming, which proved beneficial to the success 
                                            of the project.
